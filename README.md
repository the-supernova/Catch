# Catch
A basic 2-D game build with Javascript and p5.js library
## Introduction
Making games in Javascript is cool to see but equally hectic to complete! So this time I came up with learning to make mini games using Javascript and an easy to use (yet rarely used) Javascript library **p5.js**.This library is used for creative coding and making animations.
## Instructions
* Use the cursor for moving the basket left and right
* Collect all the balls falling from the sky
* As you collect a ball, the color of basket changes accordingly and the scoreboard updates
* Game ends when you miss a ball
* To play again, press f5 or just refresh the page
* Enjoy!
