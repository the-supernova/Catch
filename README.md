## Introduction
Making games in Javascript is cool to see but equally hectic to complete! So this time I came up with learning to make **mini games** using Javascript and an easy to use (yet rarely used) Javascript library **p5.js**.This library is used for creative coding and making animations.
## Demo

## Instructions
* Use the cursor for moving the basket left and right
* Collect all the balls falling from the sky
* As you collect a ball, the color of basket changes accordingly and the scoreboard updates
* Game ends when you miss a ball
* To play again, press f5 or just refresh the page
* Enjoy!


P.S- This game is void of good design and colors because my sole motive of making it was to learn and implement quickly.
